\# Product Return Probability Predictor



\## 📌 Project Overview

The Product Return Probability Predictor is a Machine Learning–based application that predicts the likelihood of a product being returned by a customer.  

This project helps e-commerce businesses reduce return rates and improve decision-making by identifying high-risk orders in advance.

\## ❓ Problem Statement

Product returns cause significant losses in e-commerce due to logistics, refunds, and inventory handling.  

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the probability of a product return based on customer, order, and product-related features.

\## 🤖 Machine Learning Model Explanation

\- The project uses supervised machine learning techniques.

\- Historical order data is used for training.

\- The model learns patterns from features such as:

&nbsp; - Product category

&nbsp; - Price

&nbsp; - Customer behavior

&nbsp; - Order details

\- The trained model outputs a probability score indicating the chance of return.



\*\*Model Type:\*\* Classification Model  

\*\*Evaluation Metrics:\*\* Accuracy, Precision, Recall
